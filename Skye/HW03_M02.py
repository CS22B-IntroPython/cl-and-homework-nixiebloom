#### Part I: Employee Performance Report (Contol flow exercises)
### Given a list of employees (dictionary containing emplyee's name, salary, department, and performance score),
# Your task is to:
# A. Calculate the average performance score for each employee
# B. Classify each employee based on the average performance score and print out the classification for each employee. The classification is as follows:
# - "Excellent" if the average score is 4.5 or above
# - "Good" if the average score is between 3.5 and 4.4 (inclusive)
# - "Needs Improvement" if the average score is below 3.5
# C. Find the employee with the highest salary in the "Engineering" department, and
# D. Print a dictionary where the keys are the department names and the values are lists of employee names who belong to the "Excellent" category in each department.


employees = [
    {"name": "Alice", "salary": 50000, "department": "Marketing", "performance_scores": [4.0, 4.5, 3.8, 3.2]},
    {"name": "Bob", "salary": 60000, "department": "Engineering", "performance_scores": [4.2, 4.7, 4.1, 4.3]},
    {"name": "Richard", "salary": 200000, "department": "Engineering", "performance_scores": [2.2, 2.7, 2.1, 2.3]},
    {"name": "Charlie Li", "salary": 75000, "department": "HR", "performance_scores": [3.9, 3.2, 3.5, 2.8]},
    {"name": "Diana", "salary": 55000, "department": "Marketing", "performance_scores": [4.8, 4.5, 4.2, 4.6]},
    {"name": "Mark Brown", "salary": 75000, "department": "HR", "performance_scores": [4.6, 4.8, 4.9, 4.7]},
    {"name": "Mary Lou Richard", "salary": 55000, "department": "Marketing", "performance_scores": [2.4, 2.2, 3.1, 2.7]}
]


### Part A: Calculate the average performance score for each employee
print(type(employees))
print(employees["name"])

for e in employees:
    scores = employees["performance_scores"]
    average_score = sum(scores) / len(scores)
    print(f"{employees['name']}: {average_score:.2f}")


### Part B: Classify each employee based on the average performance score and print out the classification for each employee
## Let's make this a function so we can reuse it in Part D
#def employee_classification (employees):
    #ec_list = []
    #for e in employees:
        #print("hi")
    
#ec_list = employee_classification(employees)


### Part C. Find the employee with the highest salary in the "Engineering" department, and
#highest_salary = 0
#for e in employees:
    #if e["department"]=="Engineering":


### Part D. Print a dictionary where the keys are the department names and the values are lists of employee names who belong to the "Excellent" category in each department.
#excellent_emp = {}
#ec_list = employee_classification(employees)

#for e in ec_list:
